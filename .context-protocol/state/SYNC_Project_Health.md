## ISSUES

### MONOLITH (2 files)

**What's wrong:** Large files are hard to navigate, test, and maintain. They slow down agents who need to load context, and changes become risky because side effects are hard to predict.

**How to fix:** Extract cohesive functionality into separate modules. Start with the largest functions/classes listed above.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Refactor_Improve_Code_Structure.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `src/context_protocol/doctor.py` - 1217 lines (threshold: 800)
  - Split: def doctor_check_new_undoc_code() (127L, :671), def doctor_command() (86L, :1405), def doctor_check_conflicts() (77L, :1077)
- `src/context_protocol/repair.py` - 1918 lines (threshold: 800)
  - Split: def get_issue_instructions() (725L, :398), def repair_command() (439L, :1893), def run_repair() (291L, :2041)

### INCOMPLETE_IMPL (1 files)

**What's wrong:** Empty functions indicate incomplete implementation. The interface exists but the behavior doesn't.

**How to fix:** Fill in the empty functions with actual implementation.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `src/context_protocol/repair.py` - Contains 5 empty/incomplete function(s)

## HANDOFF

**For the next agent:**

Before starting your task, consider addressing critical issues - especially if your work touches affected files. Monoliths and undocumented code will slow you down.

**Recommended first action:** Pick one MONOLITH file you'll be working in and split its largest function into a separate module.
