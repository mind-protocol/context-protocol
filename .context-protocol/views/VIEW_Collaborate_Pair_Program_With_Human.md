# VIEW: Collaborate

**You're working alongside a human in real-time — pair programming, co-designing, or interactive problem-solving.**

---

## WHY THIS VIEW EXISTS

Collaboration is different from solo work:
- The human has context you don't
- Decisions happen in dialogue, not documentation
- Speed matters — long doc lookups break flow
- You're augmenting human thinking, not replacing it

This view is about being a good partner in real-time work.

## CONTEXT TO LOAD

**FIRST: Read the documentation listed below before starting.** Even in real-time work, context prevents mistakes. Do not skip this step.

### Minimal Pre-Load

At minimum, load:
- Project SYNC (quick orientation)
- Module PATTERNS if working on specific module

For additional docs, load on demand as the work progresses — but always read before modifying.

### Let the Human Guide

The human knows what they're trying to do. Ask clarifying questions rather than assuming.

## COLLABORATION PRINCIPLES

### Follow the Human's Lead

They have context about:
- Why this matters right now
- What constraints exist
- What they've already tried
- Political/social factors you can't see

### Think Out Loud

Share your reasoning. The human can correct misunderstandings early.

### Ask Before Acting

In real-time work, check understanding before making significant changes.

### Surface Concerns

If you see issues, raise them. But don't block — note concerns and continue if the human decides to proceed.

### Document As You Go

Real-time work creates decisions that get lost. Periodically capture:
- Decisions made
- Rationale
- Open questions

---

## WHEN TO SLOW DOWN

If the work touches:
- Core design patterns
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Other people's code

...suggest pausing to load relevant docs. Quick now can mean painful later.

---

## HANDOFFS

**For next agent:** Summary of what was done in the session, decisions made, state of work.

**For human (end of session):** 
- What was accomplished
- Decisions that were made
- What needs follow-up
- Any concerns raised but not resolved

---

## VERIFICATION

During collaboration, periodically check:
- Does the human seem aligned with the direction?
- Are decisions being captured?
- Is there anything that should be documented more formally?
- Should we pause to consult existing docs?
