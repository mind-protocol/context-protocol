# MODULE MANIFEST
# =============================================================================
#
# This file maps code to documentation and carries rich context about each module.
#
# WHEN TO UPDATE:
# - Creating new code directories → add module mapping
# - Creating new doc modules → add mapping
# - Refactoring/moving code → update patterns
# - Changing module maturity → update status
#
# VALIDATION:
# `ngram validate` warns about unmapped code directories.

  prompt:
    code: "ngram/prompt.py"
    docs: "docs/cli/prompt/"
    maturity: DESIGNING
    owner: agent
    entry_points:
      - "ngram/prompt.py"
    depends_on:
      - cli_core
    patterns:
      - "Bootstrap prompt anchors agents to PROTOCOL + PRINCIPLES before working"
      - "Work mode guidance + VIEW table keep agents from default behavior"
    notes: |
      Provides the `ngram prompt` command that bootstraps LLMs with canonical docs,
      VIEW choices, and verification reminders. Module is intentionally simple, but
      must stay in sync with the broader CLI doc chain.

  cli_core:
    code: "ngram/**"
    docs: "docs/cli/core/"
    maturity: CANONICAL
    owner: agent
    entry_points:
      - "ngram/cli.py"
    depends_on:
      - prompt
    notes: |
      Central CLI entrypoints, health commands, and navigation helpers. This module
      covers `doctor`, `repair`, `validate`, and related utils; docs describe the
      CLI architecture and how each check integrates into health workflows.

  llm_agents:
    code: "ngram/llms/**"
    docs: "docs/llm_agents/"
    maturity: DESIGNING
    owner: agent
    notes: |
      Agent-facing integrations (Claude, Gemini, Codex) that spawn subprocesses,
      manage prompts, and track telemetry. Docs capture the agent behaviors and
      health checks tied to the language-model integrations.

  tui:
    code: "ngram/tui/**"
    docs: "docs/tui/"
    maturity: DESIGNING
    owner: agent
    notes: |
      The textual UI that wraps CLI workflows in a persistent session. Docs outline
      behaviors, patterns, and implementation details for widgets, commands, and
      docking points observed by doctor health checks.
