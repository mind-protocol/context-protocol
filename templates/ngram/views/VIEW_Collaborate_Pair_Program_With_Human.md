# VIEW: Collaborate / Pair Program

**You're working in real-time with a human on code.**

---

## WHY THIS VIEW EXISTS

Pair programming requires a different mode than solo work:
- Faster iteration, less upfront planning
- Human provides context verbally, not via docs
- Focus on the immediate task, trust human guidance

This view keeps you responsive while maintaining quality.

---

## CONTEXT TO LOAD

### Minimal Upfront

1. **Project state:** `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
   - Quick scan for recent context

2. **Module docs on demand:**
   - Load only when human points you to specific code
   - Ask before assuming structure

### During Session

- **Follow human lead** — They know the codebase
- **Ask clarifying questions** — Don't guess
- **Read files as needed** — Human will direct you

---

## HOW TO WORK

### Responsiveness Over Completeness

- Short responses, quick iterations
- Show code, get feedback, iterate
- Don't over-explain unless asked

### Trust But Verify

- Human knows intent, you know syntax
- Suggest improvements, don't enforce
- Flag concerns but don't block

### State Tracking

- Keep mental note of changes made
- Offer to update SYNC at session end
- Human decides what gets documented

---

## AFTER SESSION

If significant changes were made:

1. **Offer to update SYNC** — "Want me to record what we did?"
2. **Offer to commit** — "Ready to commit these changes?"
3. **Note any todos** — Capture follow-up items

Human decides scope of documentation.

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Long explanations before acting
- Loading extensive context upfront
- Blocking on missing documentation
- Over-engineering without human approval

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- Human feels supported, not slowed down
- Code quality maintained
- Session ends with clear state
