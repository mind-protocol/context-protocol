# node_kit - Sync: Current State

LAST_UPDATED: 2026-03-25
UPDATED_BY: codex
STATUS: DESIGNING
```

---

## MATURITY

**Canonical (v1 intent):**

* typed node variants (Player/UI/Module/GraphQueries/Moment/Agent/TickCron)
* title prominent, file path discreet
* energy badge with deterministic bucket mapping
* internal step list with singular active highlight
* separate LLM CLI Agent nodes

**In design:**

* flipped node signal source
* energy scale assumptions (0..1 vs unbounded)

---

## CURRENT STATE

Implemented node component variants with consistent theming, energy badges, step lists, player wait progress, and tick cron ring. Active step highlight derives from state_store active_focus.

---

## IN PROGRESS

Tracking the flipped node signal source and the unbounded versus 0..1 energy scale quibble while the node kit styling stays stable so downstream agents can land on the canonical wiring before the module is marked ready. The signal source story is paired with energy badge telemetry reviews so that the energy bucket mapping can be locked and the canonical status can be claimed without visual drift.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Node energy bucket mappings remain under review because the flipped signal source is still in design and may relabel buckets until the wiring is finalized, so every future story that surfaces bucket translations needs to reference this sync entry.
- `ngram validate` continues to surface DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warnings for the broader `docs/connectome/health` stack, so the node kit sync now documents its own compliance while the health docs stay on the radar.
- The only verification for node visibility, energy, and timer truths is the manual `pnpm connectome:health node_kit` run, so automation is still needed before this module can be assumed canonical.

---

## AGENT OBSERVATIONS

### Remarks

- Documenting the template sections surfaced the exact DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT failure points so downstream agents now have an explicit narrative to follow before touching this module again.

### Suggestions

<!-- @ngram:todo Automate the `pnpm connectome:health node_kit` verification once the node kit health harness stabilizes so the energy/step/timer invariants do not depend solely on manual runs. -->

### Propositions

- Continue revisiting the energy scale and signal-source story so this sync can retire the IN PROGRESS entry and mark the node kit as canonical once the wiring is settled.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

The next agent should keep following `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md`, note the manual health command in TODO, and refresh these template sections plus the pointer list whenever any energy badge or signal source wiring work lands.

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

Please decide whether to automate the `pnpm connectome:health node_kit` command and conclude the energy bucket mapping so future agents can drop the IN PROGRESS flag with confidence.

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

The node kit sync now records the template-gap fix, the outstanding manual verification, and the pointer map so future consciousness traces explain why the module still sits in DESIGNING status despite the node rendering implementation having shipped.

## POINTERS

- `docs/connectome/node_kit/PATTERNS_Connectome_Node_Kit_Typed_Language_Coded_Energy_Aware_Node_Rendering_Patterns.md` anchors the current sync through its pattern scope, behavior guardrails, and inspiration cues that explain why the node kit needs this narrative.
- `docs/connectome/node_kit/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Node_Kit_Component_Map_And_Styling_Tokens.md` documents the component map, styling tokens, and runtime assumptions that this sync tracks whenever the energy badge or step list changes.
- `docs/connectome/node_kit/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Node_Kit_Visible_Clarity_And_Trust_Effects.md` enumerates the observable clarity/trust effects, anti-behaviors, and objectives that the node kit invariants guard against before updating the sync.
- `docs/connectome/node_kit/VALIDATION_Connectome_Node_Kit_Invariants_For_Node_Readability_And_State_Reflection.md` captures the guaranteed properties, objectives, and verification steps that must remain true before this module can be assumed stable.
