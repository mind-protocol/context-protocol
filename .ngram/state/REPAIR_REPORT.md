### Task: ESCALATION - skills - SKILL_Ingest_Raw_Data_Sources_And_Route_To_Modules

**Target:** `.claude/skills/SKILL_Ingest_Raw_Data_Sources_And_Route_To_Modules.md`
**Issue Type:** ESCALATION
**GitHub Issue:** #11

**Outcome:** SKIPPED

**Reason:** Human explicitly indicated "(No decisions provided - skip this issue)". The skill file contains standard documentation about *when* to use escalation markers as part of the ingest workflow, but contains no actual unresolved escalation conflicts requiring decisions.

**Analysis:**
- Conflicts list was empty: `[]`
- File documents escalation pattern usage, not an active escalation
- No contradictions between docs/code to resolve

**Files reviewed (no changes):**
- `.claude/skills/SKILL_Ingest_Raw_Data_Sources_And_Route_To_Modules.md`
- `.ngram/views/VIEW_Specify_Design_Vision_And_Architecture.md`
- `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
