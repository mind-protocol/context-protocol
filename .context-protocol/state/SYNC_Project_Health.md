## ISSUES

### MONOLITH (2 files)

**What's wrong:** Large files are hard to navigate, test, and maintain. They slow down agents who need to load context, and changes become risky because side effects are hard to predict.

**How to fix:** Extract cohesive functionality into separate modules. Start with the largest functions/classes listed above.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Refactor_Improve_Code_Structure.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `src/context_protocol/doctor_checks.py` - 1407 lines (threshold: 800)
  - Split: def doctor_check_doc_duplication() (155L, :1273), def doctor_check_new_undoc_code() (127L, :655), def doctor_check_long_strings() (94L, :1640)
- `src/context_protocol/repair.py` - 1386 lines (threshold: 800)
  - Split: def repair_command() (439L, :1236), def run_repair() (291L, :1384), def spawn_repair_agent() (224L, :514)

## HANDOFF

**For the next agent:**

Before starting your task, consider addressing critical issues - especially if your work touches affected files. Monoliths and undocumented code will slow you down.

**Recommended first action:** Pick one MONOLITH file you'll be working in and split its largest function into a separate module.
