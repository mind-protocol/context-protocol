## OBJECTIVES SERVED

- Keep the canvas readable even as the graph scales to thousands of nodes so operators can reason about emerging flow patterns before looking at instrumentation or logs.
- Surface camera state transitions, zone labels, and focus glows so navigation feels deterministic even when the runtime stepper pulses the graph between stages.
- Anchor every visual transition to validated store signals so the flow canvas remains a trustworthy debugging instrument rather than a speculative render.

## INPUTS / OUTPUTS

**Inputs:** The flow canvas consumes state_store selectors for nodes[], edges[], zone definitions, camera transforms, active_focus, active_edge_ids, and layout metadata (label thresholds and LOD breakpoints), plus event_model enrichments such as call_type and step_key so every visible cue is rooted in canonical signals.

**Outputs:** The renderer emits layered draw calls (zones, edges, labels), tooltip summaries, glow/pulse states, camera resets, and deterministic pan/zoom recordings that downstream overlays, instrumentation, or playback tools can reuse without re-computing the underlying graph.

**Documentation note:** Inputs are purely declarative stores and event_model metadata; outputs are visual and camera-state reflections of those validated signals.
## BEHAVIORS

### B1: Pan/zoom makes dense diagrams inspectable without shrinking labels to noise

```
GIVEN:  nodes are spaced further apart and labels remain readable
WHEN:   user pans and zooms
THEN:   user can inspect any node and edge label without losing context
AND:    reset/fit returns them to a known view
```

### B2: Zones make the system instantly legible

```
GIVEN:  FE/BE/GRAPH/AGENTS zones exist
THEN:   user can immediately identify which area each node belongs to
AND:    edges crossing zones feel meaningful rather than spaghetti
```

### B3: Stepper focus never causes edge disappearance

```
GIVEN:  user clicks Next repeatedly
THEN:   edges remain rendered and stable
AND:    only focus/glow/pulse changes
```

### B4: Hovering provides clarifying remarks without clutter

```
GIVEN:  user hovers a node or edge
THEN:   a tooltip displays payload summary, rate, and notes (including “?”)
AND:    the main map remains uncluttered
```

### B5: Fit-to-view restores orientation

```
GIVEN:  user pans/zooms far away
WHEN:   user clicks “fit”
THEN:   camera returns to a stable view framing the zone containers
```

---

## EDGE CASES

### E1: Window resize

```
GIVEN:  viewport resizes
THEN:   camera transform remains valid and edges do not vanish
AND:    layout remains stable (no random reflow)
```

---

## ANTI-BEHAVIORS

### A1: Force layout jitter in stepper mode

```
MUST NOT: nodes move around when stepping (breaks spatial memory)
INSTEAD: force layout is computed on graph changes only; stepper focus changes are visual only
```

### A2: Label overlap as default state

```
MUST NOT: edge labels overlap to the point of unreadability at 100% zoom
INSTEAD: label placement rules and spacing prevent collisions by default
```

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* QUESTION: should labels fade when zoomed out? (likely yes, but must be predictable)
* IDEA: show only active edge label when zoom < threshold

## OBSERVATIONS

- Completing the objectives and I/O sections resolves DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 for the flow canvas chain and keeps the behavior contract in line with the canonical doc template.
- Keep tuning label declutter thresholds and zoom-based detail toggles so the readability guarantees documented in PATTERNS and VALIDATION stay true as graphs grow; the TODO list still calls this out.
