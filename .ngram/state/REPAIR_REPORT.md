## 2025-12-22: Ingest Skill Escalation

**Target:** `.claude/skills/SKILL_Ingest_Raw_Data_Sources_And_Route_To_Modules.md`
**Issue Type:** ESCALATION
**Resolution:** SKIPPED

### Analysis

The skill file is a clean skill definition document that:
- Defines the `ngram.ingest_raw_data_sources` skill
- Maps to `VIEW_Ingest_Process_Raw_Data_Sources.md`
- Specifies input/output YAML schemas
- Documents gates, evidence patterns, and markers

The file contains no explicit `@ngram:escalation` markers requiring resolution.

### Decision

Human decisions were "(No decisions provided - skip this issue)". Per instructions, this repair was skipped.

### GitHub Issue

Tracked by #11 - marked as skipped (no actionable escalation content to resolve).
