## OVERVIEW

The protocol is implemented as markdown structure and templates. The "implementation" is the file layout, how agents navigate it, and how the CLI installs and validates it.

This folder splits implementation details into:
- File structure and responsibilities
- Schemas and configuration
- Flows, dependencies, and bidirectional links

- File structure: `IMPLEMENTATION_File_Structure.md`
- Schemas and config: `IMPLEMENTATION_Schemas_And_Config.md`
- Flows and links: `IMPLEMENTATION_Flows_And_Links.md`
