## ISSUES

### BROKEN_IMPL_LINK (2 files)

**What's wrong:** IMPLEMENTATION docs reference files that don't exist. Agents following these docs will waste time looking for non-existent code.

**How to fix:** Update file paths in the IMPLEMENTATION doc to match actual locations, or remove references to deleted files.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Document_Create_Module_Documentation.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `docs/protocol/IMPLEMENTATION/IMPLEMENTATION_Overview.md` - References 4 non-existent file(s)
  - Update or remove references: ngram/CLAUDE.md, SYNC_Project_Health.md, SYNC_Project_State.md
- `docs/tui/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture_Structure.md` - References 3 non-existent file(s)
  - Update or remove references: ngram/CLAUDE.md, ngram/agents/manager/AGENTS.md, PATTERNS_TUI_Design.md

### INCOMPLETE_IMPL (4 files)

**What's wrong:** Empty functions indicate incomplete implementation. The interface exists but the behavior doesn't.

**How to fix:** Fill in the empty functions with actual implementation.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `ngram/repair_core.py` - Contains 2 empty/incomplete function(s)
- `ngram/tui/commands.py` - Contains 2 empty/incomplete function(s)
- `ngram/tui/state.py` - Contains 2 empty/incomplete function(s)
- `ngram/tui/widgets/status_bar.py` - Contains 6 empty/incomplete function(s)

### HARDCODED_CONFIG (1 files)

**What's wrong:** This issue may cause problems.

**How to fix:** Review and fix.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `ngram/llms/gemini_agent.py` - Contains hardcoded configuration values

## HANDOFF

**For the next agent:**

Before starting your task, consider addressing critical issues - especially if your work touches affected files. Monoliths and undocumented code will slow you down.

**Recommended first action:** Pick one MONOLITH file you'll be working in and split its largest function into a separate module.
