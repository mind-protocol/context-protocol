**Issue Type:** PLACEHOLDER
**Severity:** critical
**Target:** .ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md

## Instructions
## Task: Fill In Placeholders

**Target:** `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
**Problem:** Contains 1 template placeholder(s)
**Placeholders found:** ['{DATE}']

## Steps:

1. Read the VIEW doc and the file with placeholders
2. Identify each placeholder (like {MODULE_NAME}, {DESCRIPTION}, etc.)
3. Read related code/docs to understand what should replace each placeholder
4. Replace all placeholders with actual content
5. Ensure the document makes sense and is complete

## Success Criteria:
- No {PLACEHOLDER} patterns remain
- Content is meaningful, not generic
- Document is useful for agents

Report "REPAIR COMPLETE" when done, or "REPAIR FAILED: <reason>" if you cannot complete.

MANDATORY FINAL LINE:
- End your response with a standalone line: `REPAIR COMPLETE`
- If you fail, end with: `REPAIR FAILED: <reason>`
